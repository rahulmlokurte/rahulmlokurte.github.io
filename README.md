🩸 Introduction
===============
Design patterns are reusable solutions for software development. They serve as templates that programmers can use when creating applications. They are not specific to individual programming languages, but instead are the best practices that can be applied in different programming environments.
Being a software engineer you are expected to build software that makes sense.

🩸 Importance of Design Patterns
================================
🎱 It speeds up the dev-test process.

🎱 It makes code reusable.

🎱 It makes a code bug-free, and clean.

🎱 Easy to change as requirement changes.

🎱 Code becomes modular.

🩸 Classification of Design Patterns
====================================
🎱 [Creational](#-creational-design-patterns)

🎱 [Structural](#-structural-design-patterns)

🎱 [Behavioral](#-behavioral-design-patterns)

🩸 Creational Design Patterns
=============================
Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. The following are the design patterns which fall under creational patterns.

🎱 Factory Method

🎱 Abstract Factory

🎱 Builder

🎱 Prototype

🎱 Singleton

🩸 Structural Design Patterns
=============================
Structural patterns explain how to assemble objects and classes into larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient.

🎱 Adapter

🎱 Decorator

🎱 Facade

🎱 Proxy

🎱 Bridge

🩸 Behavioral Design Patterns
=============================
Behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects.

🎱 Iterator

🎱 Observer

🎱 Command

🎱 Strategy

🎱 Template

🎱 Visitor
