Design Pattern is a topic which you will get hold when you see the patterns in the code or in real world. We have common recurring problem and design pattern is a solution to some of those problems.

🩸 Introduction
===============
Design patterns are reusable solutions for software development. They serve as templates that programmers can use when creating applications. They are not specific to individual programming languages, but instead are the best practices that can be applied in different programming environments.
Being a software engineer you are expected to build software that makes sense.

🩸 Importance of Design Patterns
================================
🎱 It speeds up the dev-test process.

🎱 It makes code reusable.

🎱 It makes a code bug-free, and clean.

🎱 Easy to change as requirement changes.

🎱 Code becomes modular.

🩸 Classification of Design Patterns
====================================
🎱 [Creational](#-creational-design-patterns)

🎱 [Structural](#-structural-design-patterns)

🎱 [Behavioral](#-behavioral-design-patterns)

🩸 Creational Design Patterns
=============================
Creational patterns provide various object creation mechanisms, which increase flexibility and reuse of existing code. The following are the design patterns which fall under creational patterns.

🎱 Factory Method

🎱 Abstract Factory

🎱 Builder

🎱 Prototype

🎱 Singleton

🩸 Structural Design Patterns
=============================
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

🩸 Behavioral Design Patterns
=============================
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
